# Swagger generated server

## Overview

This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a swagger-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

## Requirements

Python 3.6.4+

## Usage

To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m swagger_server
```

and open your browser to here:

```bash
http://localhost:8080/poi_api/
```

Your Swagger definition lives here:

```bash
http://localhost:8080/poi_api/swagger.json
```

To launch the integration tests, use tox:

```bash
sudo pip install tox
tox
```

## Running with Docker
